# Portfolio-CSS

Work individually to implement the following user story:

* As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I can load the portfolio and see the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to each section: about them, their work, and contact information.

* It is done when I click on a link in the navigation bar and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

* It is done when I click on the 'work' link and the UI scrolls to the section with the titled images of the developer's applications.

* It is done when I view the developer's first application and this application is larger in size than the others.

* It is done when I click on the images of the applications and I am taken to that deployed application.

* It is done when the screen is resized and I view a responsive layout that adapst to my viewport.

## Notes

The following link presents the deployed application:
